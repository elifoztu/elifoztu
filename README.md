# Hey there! 👋 I'm Elif

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a CS student at the University of Iowa who loves building things that actually help people.

## What I'm up to these days

🎓 **Studying:** Computer Science & Engineering (graduating 2027) with an econ minor because why not understand how the world works too

🤖 **Currently obsessing over:** AI/ML stuff through Break Through Tech (somehow got picked from 3000+ people??) and working with Ford's AI team on some pretty cool autonomous driving projects

🔬 **Research nerd:** Spending way too much time in the Holo Reality Lab building assistive tech for people with visual impairments - it's actually really rewarding work

## Languages I speak (to computers)
Python • Java • C++ • C# • Swift • JavaScript

And I mess around with Unity, TensorFlow, and whatever other tools seem fun

## Some stuff I've built

**🚗 Ford Latitude AI project** - Built a GUI that helps find weird edge cases in self-driving car data using vision language models

**👁️ VR Eye Exams for Kids** - Making eye tests less scary for little humans by turning them into games (still working on this one!)

**📱 EchoSee** - An app that describes surroundings to visually impaired users through their phone's camera

**🏠 Airbnb Price Predictor** - Used a bunch of ML models to figure out how much NYC listings should cost

## Experience & Leadership
- **BackPack Games Intern** - Optimized 3D character models and implemented C# gameplay mechanics
- **Society of Women Engineers Secretary** - Organizing events and supporting women in engineering
- **Break Through Tech Student Ambassador** - Promoting tech opportunities to underrepresented students
- **ACM Active Member** - Engaging with the computing community
